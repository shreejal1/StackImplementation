# StackImplementation
Day1:
Implementing the Stack is the Lifo process in the Data Structures. Hereby,
completing the task in java uses an array of a fixed size. The items added
on the array (PUSH) is then recorded. The function of POP ideally is to view
the top item (due to LIFO, the last item added is the top) and adjacently 
delete it too. The function of PEEK is also to view the top item but without
removing it from the list.
Aditionally, the function of Status is also added on the implementation. Status
delivers the Overflow/Underflow condition, and the items (if the array has some items on it).
The test cases aren't hardcoded but lets user to perform themself.
The following options of (Push/Pop/Peek/Status) is shown and the process is
iterative until the user choose to exit (used while condition to iterate).

Day2:
Improved the method in Stack. Applied try catch to handle the exception of 
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. 
Day2 Continue:
Learned about queue and implemented it using array.
The queue is organized in FIFO. Enqueue is the process of adding items in the rear
and dequeue means releasing the items from front and re-arranging them in the queue.
PeekFirst is a simple method to view the front item in the queue.

Day3:
Learned about the Binary Tree. Performed the insert events with currently no filters
(L<R). Checks the null value if inserted -1.
